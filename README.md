# Setup

## Configruation

I use a project that contains a JSON for the for the configuration variables of this project.  The script will pull the latest config for usage from GitLab.  This
is done as there are others that use my script(s) where I work and this makes it easier for them to go in and set those vars instead of having to adjust the container/scripts.  If you want to avoid this process you can certainly bring the config into the file as well. 

You will want to make sure you have defined a few Envrionment Variables either in your .env or k8s config:

- CONFIG_PROJECT_ID = This is the Gitlab project that houses the configuration

- CONFIG_FILENAME = The name of the configuration.  If you would prefer to have this run locally, you can
                always copy the contents of config.json into the CONFIG_MAP variable and comment out
                the CONFIG_MAP = requests.get( stanza.

- CONFIG_BRANCH = This is the name of the branch that houses the config file.  Depending on when your
                project was created it might be main or master

- GL_ACCESS_TOKEN = Your private token for accessing GitLab

## Running and testing locally
This app is designed to be in a container and run via GitLab CI/CD.  So the CI/CD for this project builds and stores in the GitLab container repo.  

You can run it through local docker as well you will just need to create a .env file with GL_ACCESS_TOKEN and your personal access token for GitLab.

## Running through GitLab CI/CD
You will need to setup a job to build the container and put it in your container repository.  You will need to also define the GL_ACCESS_TOKEN variable in your variables
